# Local inference with llama.cpp

Run Agent ships llama.cpp as a trusted, hidden built-in local backend. It is exposed
through the provider-neutral `/local` command; there is no `/llama` or
`/llama-cpp` command. The built-in provider ID is `llama.cpp`, which is distinct
from an older user-created `llama-cpp` catalog provider.

## Start a server

Install llama.cpp separately. See its official
[server quick start](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md#quick-start)
and [router-mode guide](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md#using-multiple-models).
Run Agent recommends router mode for `/local` model download/load/unload management:
start the server **without** a model argument. This conservative single-user
baseline keeps only one model and one inference slot resident:

```bash
llama-server \
  --models-max 1 \
  --parallel 1 \
  --flash-attn auto
```

Some installations expose the same entry point as `llama serve`. Bare
`llama-server` also works, but its defaults permit up to four loaded models and
choose the slot count automatically. A single-model server remains supported
for inference but does not expose router management:

```bash
llama-server -hf <tool-capable-gguf>
```

There is no universally optimal llama.cpp command. For one interactive Run Agent user
with enough unified memory/VRAM and a model that supports a 65,536-token context,
a long-context profile can extend the baseline:

```bash
llama-server \
  --models-max 1 \
  --parallel 1 \
  --ctx-size 65536 \
  --flash-attn on \
  --cache-type-k q8_0 \
  --cache-type-v q8_0
```

`--models-max 1` limits simultaneous loaded models, not downloaded models.
`--parallel 1` dedicates the context/KV cache to one request instead of trading
memory for concurrent throughput. `q8_0` KV caches use less memory than the
`f16` defaults while retaining more fidelity than lower-bit cache types.
`--ctx-size 65536` can still be too large for the hardware or model; reduce it
first when loading fails. `--flash-attn auto` is the portable default, while
`on` is appropriate only when the installed backend supports it.

Sampling and reasoning flags are model behavior, not general performance
optimizations. `--min-p 0` disables llama.cpp's default min-p sampler.
`--reasoning-effort medium` (or the older template-kwargs equivalent) and
`--reasoning-preserve` should be added only for templates that support those
features. Check the model card and run `/local` → Doctor rather than applying
those flags to every model.

The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Run Agent does not install, start,
stop, or scan for llama.cpp. In compatible router mode it can explicitly ask the
independent server to download a model; Run Agent never writes or deletes model files.

## Configure `/local`

Open Run Agent and run:

```text
/local
```

Choose the recommended `llama.cpp` backend and confirm the choice, even when it
is the only backend. Run Agent immediately probes the saved endpoint,
`LLAMA_BASE_URL`, or the default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Use **Configure** to
enter another server URL, with or without `/v1`, and an optional API key. Run Agent
probes only that one effective endpoint; it never scans ports, processes, or the
local network.

Endpoint precedence is:

1. a URL submitted through **Configure**;
2. the saved endpoint;
3. `LLAMA_BASE_URL` for the current process;
4. `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as the offered default.

Opening the confirmed backend triggers the probe. Probing the offered default
makes discovered models available for the current Run Agent process but does not save
the endpoint; use **Configure** to persist it. Successful discovery uses the
exact IDs returned by `/v1/models` and never requires a fake model ID.

Use the optional key in one of these ways:

- enter it in the secret `/local` field; Run Agent stores it in `~/.run/credentials.json`;
- set `LLAMA_API_KEY` for an environment-only setup;
- leave both empty for an unauthenticated server.

A stored key takes precedence over `LLAMA_API_KEY`. Without a key Run Agent sends no
`Authorization` header. Keys are never written to the llama.cpp state file,
sessions, exports, or diagnostics.

## Select and use a model

After setup:

```text
/model
```

The picker shows server-reported model IDs and display names. Use an explicit
provider and exact model ID for startup, especially in scripts:

```bash
run-agent --provider llama.cpp --model <model-id>
run-agent --provider llama.cpp --model <model-id> --print "summarize this project"
```

Both print mode and the TUI load the built-in provider before validating an
explicit selection. A saved safe snapshot lets an explicit startup continue
when the server is temporarily down. If there are several models, headless
startup requires the exact `--model`; Run Agent never silently picks a different
explicit model. Local inference is not an automatic global-provider fallback.

The safe integration snapshot is stored at:

```text
~/.run/state/extensions/llama.cpp.json
```

It contains only the endpoint, selected model reference, allowlisted model
metadata, and a timestamp. The file is versioned, locked, atomically replaced,
and private. Dynamic provider definitions are not copied into `catalog.toml` or
`providers.json`.

## Router management and scoped models

Refresh enables management only when `/props` identifies a router in Run Agent's
tested llama.cpp build range, **b9688–b10595**. Unknown/incompatible routers
fall back to standard `/v1/models` discovery without mutation controls.
Single-model servers remain fully supported.

`/local` separates server-reported model states from backend actions. The model
section handles load, use, and unload; the actions section contains Hugging Face
search/download, connection configuration, refresh, Doctor, and reset. Only the
focused section shows a `focused` marker, accent border, and highlighted row,
making Enter's target explicit. Arrow keys move within and between sections; Tab
switches sections directly. Only loaded and sleeping models
appear in `/model`. Router models in the `unloaded` state are labelled
**available to load**; press Enter on one to review a loading confirmation.
Enter on a loaded/sleeping row offers use or unload. Load,
unload, and server-side download
are explicit and require confirmation; loading also asks whether to keep or
unload other active shared-router models. Cancellation uses
llama.cpp's documented unload operation and refreshes state. Connection loss
also refreshes when possible and never replays an interrupted mutation.

Choose **Download an exact Hugging Face model…** and enter
`owner/repository[:quantization]`, or choose **Search Hugging Face models…** and
select a repository/quantization result. Run Agent shows a separate confirmation with
the selected model and its known download size before starting the server-side
download. Cancel remains preselected as a safety default but is not labelled as
a recommendation. While the router reports byte totals, `/local` shows a
full-width block progress bar, transferred bytes, and bytes remaining. Closing
`/local` leaves the llama.cpp download running; reopening it refreshes server
status, reattaches to the latest byte progress, and offers **Cancel active
download…** to stop it explicitly.
Search reports gating, quantizations, and sizes. `Q4_K_M`
is a UI recommendation only. Run Agent
discovers `HF_TOKEN` from
the environment or standard Hugging Face token files for search, but never saves
or forwards it. The independent llama.cpp process separately needs its own token
to download gated repositories after their terms are accepted.

Loaded/sleeping models can be toggled through `/scoped-models`. Only the exact
`llama.cpp` provider/model pair is persisted. If unloaded later, the reference
stays visible as unavailable and cannot synthesize availability or trigger a
load/download; remove it or explicitly manage it through `/local`.

## Status, refresh, doctor, and reset

`/local` provides status and refresh. Refresh updates the complete model
snapshot atomically. Temporary downtime retains the last safe snapshot and marks
it stale; it does not erase the active provider or block unrelated providers.
If the server no longer reports the active model, Run Agent keeps the current runtime
usable, marks the snapshot stale, and does not offer a replacement model without
an explicit selection after the original model returns.

`doctor` is an explicit action. It reports endpoint reachability, model discovery,
streaming, tool-schema acceptance, and observed tool-call emission. A model that
streams but does not emit the probe tool receives a compatibility warning, not a
connectivity failure. Use a tool-capable instruct model and the server's required
chat-template options when tool calls are unavailable.

Reset removes only Run Agent's llama.cpp integration settings and safe snapshots. It
never stops the external server or deletes model files. Settings reset and stored
credential deletion are separate actions; a credential is retained until its
separate deletion confirmation succeeds.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused or timeout:** start `llama-server`, check the exact URL,
  and run `/local` → Refresh. Run Agent does not discover a different port.
- **HTTP 401/403:** enter the server's configured key in `/local`, or set
  `LLAMA_API_KEY`. A stored key wins over the environment value.
- **Loading:** wait for llama.cpp to finish loading, then refresh.
- **`model limit reached` during download:** the shared router rejected the
  request. Review `/local`; unload another model only if intended, or try again
  later. Run Agent refreshes state and shows the router's exact rejection message.
- **Malformed or empty `/v1/models`:** inspect the server response and model
  loading state. Run Agent does not invent an ID or metadata.
- **Print mode says the model is unavailable:** configure `/local` first and
  pass both `--provider llama.cpp` and the exact discovered `--model`. A cached
  snapshot can work offline, but a first-time explicit model needs discovery.
- **Tools are not called:** run Doctor. Streaming can work while a model's GGUF
  chat template does not support tools. Use a tool-capable instruct GGUF and
  check llama.cpp's template/server flags.
- **An old `llama-cpp` provider still exists:** it is a separate manually
  configured provider. Use `llama.cpp` for the built-in backend, or keep the old
  provider for its existing catalog configuration.

## Migration from manual local providers

Existing custom OpenAI-compatible providers continue to work. To move a
manually configured llama.cpp server to the built-in integration, open
`/local`, choose and confirm the recommended backend, enter the endpoint and
optional key, then use the exact ID returned by `/v1/models`. The built-in
provider ID is `llama.cpp`; an older `llama-cpp` catalog entry is not migrated,
rewritten, or removed automatically. Remove that entry only after verifying the
new session. Ollama and other local servers remain supported through the custom
provider path and are not registered as Run Agent backends.

Run Agent never copies old fake keys, fake model IDs, catalog definitions, project
settings, or environment endpoints into the built-in state. Reset removes only
built-in settings and safe snapshots; it never stops a server or deletes model
files.

For project trust and the security boundary, see `security.md`. For command
flags and print/TUI startup, see `cli.md`, `tui.md`, and `models.md`.

Router actions never silently load, unload, download, restore, or delete
anything. Review refreshed shared-router state before every manual retry.
