# Project trust and security

Run Agent resolves trust for the canonical destination cwd before reading ambient
project Markdown/JSON or importing project extensions. Protected inputs include
project skills, prompts, themes, system-prompt files, `AGENTS.md` context,
extension candidates, and reserved project settings.

Interactive users can save exact or displayed-parent decisions or choose a
run-only result. Headless `ask`/`never` decisions decline project inputs;
`--approve` and `--no-approve` are run-only overrides. Cancelling an interactive
trust decision exits startup or preserves the current session during reload and
replacement. Trust is committed only after the staged session is adopted.

## Built-in local-backend boundary

The bundled llama.cpp backend is trusted Run Agent package code. It loads before the
project-trust decision, remains available with `--no-extensions`, and never
creates a project trust prompt. Its provider/backend definitions are owned by
the active extension-runtime generation. Endpoint settings and allowlisted model
snapshots are user-level integration state, not project inputs; they live under
`~/.run/state/extensions/llama.cpp.json`.

After the user confirms a backend, `/local` probes only the endpoint they
entered, saved, supplied through `LLAMA_BASE_URL`, or accepted as the default. It
does not scan processes, ports, or the local network. Run Agent does not install,
start, or stop llama.cpp and never writes or deletes model files. On a compatible
router, an explicit confirmed action can ask the independent llama.cpp server to
download a selected model.

## Credentials and safe state

API keys are collected through secret fields. A stored key is kept in Run Agent's
private credential store and referenced by an opaque integration-owned name.
`LLAMA_API_KEY` is an environment fallback. If neither is present, Run Agent omits
`Authorization`; it never synthesizes a fake local key. Stored credentials win
over the environment value.

The llama.cpp state file contains only the normalized endpoint, exact
server-reported model IDs, allowlisted display/context/modality metadata, the
selected reference, and a timestamp. It does not contain keys, arbitrary
headers, server PIDs, project-local overrides, or raw server payloads. Secrets
are excluded from provider representations, diagnostics, sessions, and exports.
State and credential writes are separate transactions: a failed state commit
leaves the prior configuration active and an unreferenced credential is cleaned
up or reported for recovery; old-credential cleanup failure does not invalidate
the committed new configuration. Reset removes safe settings first and deletes a
stored credential only after separate confirmation.

## General boundary

Project trust is an input-loading guard, not a filesystem, process, shell,
network, tool, credential, provider, model, package-install, prompt-injection,
or exfiltration sandbox. Extensions execute arbitrary Python. Use an OS
sandbox, container, VM, remote environment, and restricted credentials/network
when isolation is required.

For endpoint, auth, cached-downtime, Doctor, and model-selection troubleshooting,
see `local-inference.md`.

## Migration boundary

The built-in `llama.cpp` integration does not import or rewrite an existing
`llama-cpp` catalog entry. Configure it separately through `/local`, verify the
exact model ID returned by `/v1/models`, and remove the old entry only when it
is no longer needed. Ollama, gateways, and other local servers remain on the
manual custom-provider path. No built-in operation starts, stops, downloads, or
deletes an external server or model file without an explicit supported action.
